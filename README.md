# 🧪 Owen Chappell's App Lab

Welcome to my official collection of desktop apps created with Python and creativity.

## 🎮 What’s Inside?

This repository contains all of my compiled EXE apps along with their original Python source code and assets (like icons or sounds). Each app lives in its own folder with everything you need to run or edit it.

---

## 🖥️ How to Use

1. Browse the folders to find an app.
2. Open the folder and download the `.exe` file.
3. Double-click to run on any Windows computer.
4. No installation required — they’re all standalone.

## 🛠️ Built With

- Python 3.11+
- Tkinter
- PyInstaller
- Custom icon and asset files
